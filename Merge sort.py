#Merge sort (polish version and commentary will be added later)

#Merge sort uses Divide and conquer algorithm in order to work
#Divide and conquer algorithm works by breaking down problem (list/array) in multiple subprolblems (sublists) recursively
#until they become simple to solve and are combined to solve original problem
#the created sublists will already one element arrays which we will be merging together to make them sorted

#Merge sort has O(n*log(n)) time complexity
